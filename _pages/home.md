I'm really passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles.

Currently, I'm studying CS && Physics at the University of Virginia. I'm also interning as a software engineer at Uber Advanced Technologies Group to help develop HD Maps for our fleet of self-driving cars.
 
In addition to self driving cars, I'm very interested in machine learning, growth engineering, and brand creation. In my free time, I enjoy [reading][reading] and [painting][painting].
