My name is Rohan Raval, and I'm studying Computer Science and Physics at the University of Virginia.

I'm passionate about autonomous vehicles and cyber-physical robotics. I'm invested in  researching and developing new and innovative solutions to create safe and accessible transportation. In addition to self driving cars, I'm very interested in machine learning (particularly deep learning) and growth engineering in tech startups, as well as emerging technologies like blockchain.

In my free time, I enjoy [reading][reading] and [painting][painting]. I'm always seeking opportunities that align with my interests, so free to check out my [Resume][resume], or reach out to me via Email or Twitter.
