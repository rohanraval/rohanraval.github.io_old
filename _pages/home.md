I'm studying CS && Physics at the University of Virginia. This spring, I'm developing and teaching a new intro course on robotics, listed as [CS 1501] at UVa. After college, I'll be working on autonomous vehicles as a software engineer @[UberATG][uber].

I'm super interested in autonomous robotics -- currently I'm trying to learn more about motion control for unmanned aerial vehicles. My other interests include growth engineering and machine learning. I also like to read.

Check out my [blog][blog] or my [portfolio][github]. Feel free to shoot me an [email][email] if you want to chat!
